Data Protection, Privacy and Compliance
=====


1. How is the data protected? What is the data protection policy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

510, the digital and data unit, is part of The Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC). The NLRC has a **Data Protection Policy** enforced since 2018. **Both the NLRC and the Reliefbox adhere to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. The GDPR also specifies data breach reporting, which must be reported to the Dutch Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens.

NLRC employs a legal officer specialized in data protection. NLRC is a data processor for the client, as stated in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). For more information about data processors, visit:  
https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors/

The partner remains the data controller and is responsible for any data entered into the platform. They must ensure compliance with their own data protection legislation.

Please contact our Account Manager Team to **discuss any requirements and questions** regarding our GDPR responsibilities at ``info@510.global``.


2. Where and how do you store and process data?
------------------------------------------------

Reliefbox and NLRC adhere to the GDPR. Data is stored, hosted, and processed in Western Europe.


3. What is your cloud server and host provider?
------------------------------------------------

Reliefbox runs in Microsoft Azure Cloud, with all resources located in Western Europe by default. On request, hosting in a different region may be possible. Please contact ``info@510.global`` for further information.
It may also be possible to host Reliefbox in the country where data storage and processing occur, subject to Azure datacenter availability.


4. Can you host the data in-country?
-------------------------------------

Depending on Azure datacenter availability, data storage and processing may be hosted in-country. Alternative options, such as other IaaS/PaaS providers or on-premise hosting solutions, can be discussed.
Please contact us at ``info@510.global`` to discuss the best alternatives.


5. In which geographical locations do you store or process data?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data is stored, hosted, and processed in Western Europe on Azure Cloud servers.


6. How long do you store the data?

Data is stored for a maximum of 7 years on our Azure cloud server after the last update. Data not updated within 7 years will be deleted. If a shorter storage period is required, please contact our team.

The client can delete data at any time. 


7. How do you ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability?
